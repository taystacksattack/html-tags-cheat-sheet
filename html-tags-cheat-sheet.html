    <h1>HTML Tags Cheat Sheet</h1>

    <h2>Headings</h2>

    <p>
        Headings can be broken up by h1-h6. There should only be one h1 - that is the only one that will be evaluated when a web search is completed. Headings can have sub stuff denoted by "p."
        Yada yada. Some things can be achieved through HTML, but CSS also does much of the styling.
